      "Abstract": "This paper presents a method for creating structured representations of the working of systems from natural language descriptions using the SAPPhIRE model of causality. The method leverages natural language processing techniques to automatically extract and structure causal relationships from textual descriptions, enabling systematic analysis and comparison of system behaviors.",

      "Abstract": "This study explores how different analogy domains—biological, cross-domain engineering, and within-domain engineering—influence design novelty and selection frequency among novice product designers. Results indicate that biological analogies were frequently selected and significantly increased the novelty of designs compared to within-domain analogies. The research suggests that middle-domain analogies can be as effective as far-domain ones in promoting novelty.",

      "Abstract": "This research aims to understand the significance of biological analogies in fostering novelty by comparing them with brainstorming for idea generation. Results indicate that concepts generated using 'biocards' (biological inspiration) were ideated at higher abstraction levels than those from brainstorming, and the average novelty of biocard-generated concepts was greater. The authors suggest that better training in using biological analogies can enhance design innovation.",
